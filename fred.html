            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">During the first week, we had a general orientation about our expected job. We were tasked to create the initial design of our project. We also did basic coding in Kotlin and in Django. </div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">The second week marked the proper start of the coding of our project. I was tasked to create our local database and to implement user registration. </div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">We started to dig deeper into the more complex part of Django during the third week. I was tasked to implement a password validation system for our project. </div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">The fourth week was especially hard. I was tasked to implement user type picking and to implement image uploads. Implementing image upload took me several days. Our team also had communication problems that we tried to fix as soon as possible. </div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">The fifth week was the most peaceful week for us. Our communication became better and we finished the various tasks given to us with relative ease.</div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">Classes started during the sixth week, resulting on reduced workload since our directors told us to take it easy and focus on our studies. Because of the less work that we did during the sixth week, we extended and went into the seventh week. During the seventh week, we had a massive code cleanup in order to make our project more presentable. Thankfully, we managed to pull through and was able to present the entirety of the project in the last day.</div>
