        <div class="weekly-container limit">
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">This is our first week. We had our orientation about our job. For this week, we were tasked to create the initial design of the project. We also done basic coding using django and kotlin and introducted to project management principles.</div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">This is our second week. The proper start of creating the project. I was tasked to push the django generated files to the repository to be used for our project, as well as writing the documentation on how to run the project. We also implemented the basic user registration and authentication after that.</div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">Third week. I self-assigned myself to work on the seller side. I was working on the backend of the project. Revising the models, doing tests, and funny thing is that django unknowingly bugged for itself and I seem to not replicate the problem, so I had to recreate the virtual environment. Another funny thing is that when I pushed a file to the repository, apparently it was blocked due to a merge conflict and the problem was just a single whitespace. Fixed and pushed my code to the repo. Our team at that time had also communication problems where we do not engage conversations more.</div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">Our fourth week. A bad time that our internet died due to heavy rain on that week. Mobile data was useless, and I had the initiative to get internet. I had to go to our neighbor, used their PisoWiFi and set my OpenWRT router to extend/repeater mode, but it is not perfect, still lags but still usable. What I did on this week was that I continued my self-assigned tasks and relied only on VSCode&apos;s intellisense and Python&apos;s help() function. Since documentation was also found in the library&apos;s code, that was my only source of documentation in django. I was a blocker on that time since I cannot push my code to the repo due to a timeout error.</div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">Fifth week, still have limited internet using our neighbors PisoWiFi. I was able to push my code to the repo and self-assigned new tasks. Code optimizations from the previous codes, and writing documentation for each classes and methods. I did a bit of frontend development and actually it was fun. Our communication with our team got better than the past weeks. </div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">Sixth week, classes have started. Because of that, our workload was reduced and we extended for another week, making it seven (7) weeks. We did code cleanup, code optimizations and a last resort feature, which was receipts. We were able to present our code and the project went well.</div>
