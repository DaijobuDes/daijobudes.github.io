This is actually my\nfirst time having online classes so it would probably be hard\nfor me to adapt. Especially if devices are limited, a low-end\nlaptop, and a slow and expensive internet.</p>\n<p>As online classes start, we currently used <a href=\"https://zoom.us\">Zoom</a>, <a href=\"https://meet.google.com\">Google Meets</a> and probably <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software\">Microsoft Teams</a>.\nIt can still be hard especially if internet connection is slow,\nmaking the audio sound robotic, and stuck video. And especially the Moodle server gets down in some times.</p>\n<p>Although internet problems can be a burden in online classes,\nit shouldn’t be a problem unless internet is cut off, it is a big\nproblem to me. Using mobile data can be very wasteful, especially\nif data is limited. When it comes to using video, it would probably use up to <code class=\"language-text\">1 GB</code> of data in an average of one hour.</p>\n<p>Low-end devices like low spec’d laptops, can sometimes be\nfrustrating when a program loads very slowly, and when it comes\nto video conferencing, sometimes the program hangs due to\nhigh cpu usage, also crashing the program. The laptop camera\nsometimes would not respond resulting to display a black screen\nonly. And microphone laptop has static feedback but good thing\nthat video conferencing programs has noise suppression by\ndefault, resulting to less static feedback being heard by others\nand a clearer voice when speaking.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"MADE4Learners Framework","date":"August 24, 2020","description":"Week 1 experiences using the MADE4Learners framework."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/MADE4Learners-framework/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/about-online-privacy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"About online privacy"}},"next":null}}}
