But what about your information?</p>\n<p>In the internet, you should never ever reveal your personal information\nwhich are sensitive like your credit card, personal ID’s or any kind of\npersonal identification which are very sensitive.</p>\n<p>As a social media user, you should know how would you share your\ninformation to others, especially if that social media platform involves\nthe using of usernames, in order to hide or it serves as a cloak from your\nreal name. Especially <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a>, a social media platform\nwhich I consider as <strong>“way too personal”</strong> since we use our real names there.\nBut Facebook also filters people who are not in your country or even not your\nfriend’s friend (friends of friends). But in posting, it is recommended that you\ndo not include your real information there, and/or post something way too personal.</p>\n<p>So, I am also a <a href=\"https://discord.com\">Discord</a> user, which involves the use of\nusernames, chat or talk to people from other countries.
