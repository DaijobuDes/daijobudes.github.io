But what about your information?</p>\n<p>In the internet, you should never ever reveal your personal information\nwhich are sensitive like your credit card, personal ID’s or any kind of\npersonal identification which are very sensitive.</p>\n<p>As a social media user, you should know how would you share your\ninformation to others, especially if that social media platform involves\nthe using of usernames, in order to hide or it serves as a cloak from your\nreal name. Especially <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a>, a social media platform\nwhich I consider as <strong>“way too personal”</strong> since we use our real names there.\nBut Facebook also filters people who are not in your country or even not your\nfriend’s friend (friends of friends). But in posting, it is recommended that you\ndo not include your real information there, and/or post something way too personal.</p>\n<p>So, I am also a <a href=\"https://discord.com\">Discord</a> user, which involves the use of\nusernames, chat or talk to people from other countries. And as I have been using\nDiscord for two years now. I have seen some people use this platform for\nmalicious use like, selling information through DMs or direct messages\n(also termed as PMs or private messages), even distribute malware, still through direct\nmessages since no one can ban them on servers unless caught and will be reported\nto the Discord Team for violating the <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\">Terms of Service</a>.</p>\n<p>I only share my personal information, not credit card details or alike, to people that\nI know, or my friends and to websites that are legitimate in order for verification\npurposes and use their services.</p>\n<p>tl;dr, don’t ever share your personal information everywhere in the public internet, not\nonly your information is compromised but your identity also is.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About online privacy","date":"August 24, 2020","description":"Sharing information about one's self on social media."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about-online-privacy/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/discord-bot-updates/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Discord Bot Updates"}},"next":null}}}
