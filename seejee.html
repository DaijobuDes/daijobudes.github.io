        <div class="weekly-container limit">
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">This week was an introduction to the style of work and project management. Installing all the necessary programs and languages, for the project. During the 1st day, we were tested on whether we could make do without much supervision. We also created initial designs for the website at this time.</div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">Proper start of the web development. During this week we learned about utilizing django. I was assigned to be the sole frontend developer for the project due to necessity. At this stage, we were told to push our commits wheever so that the rest of the team could adapt.</div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">During this week, actual nitty-gritty work started. The introduction to how things worked is over and now we start on being productive and dive into more complex tasks. We were given tasks that utilize multiple technologies and had to do those within 2 weeks’ time. Furthermore, the poor implementation of classes in the CSS file caused it to bloat and making it difficult to update. This is a rookie mistake as I was unfamiliar with styling and this was a great learning experience.</div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">During this week, it was difficult to work without proper communication from teammates. There were conflicts as the model classes kept on getting modifications, which breaks our local databases making it difficult to work and test. During this time, a teammate lost internet connection which in turn blocked us from completing the rest of the sprint as his code has yet to be submitted to be implemented on the templates.</div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">During this week, communication lines between teammates became better and the teamwork improved. There were overflows from the last sprint which were then quickly dealt with at this week. The tasks assigned were as the product owner dictated.</div>
            <div class="weekly hover-zoom">The task of this week extended to a seventh week. During this time, we filled on what was needed on the website. Specific styling for specific elements, animations and hover effects. After which, the project concluded.</div>
